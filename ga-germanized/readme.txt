== Description ==

> Google Analytics preconfigured to respect EU law (GDPR / DSGVO) and with lots of advanced analytics settings for extensive tracking possibilities.

You can use this plugin to integrate Google Analytics conform to EU law in compliance with data protection. For this you only need to put your Google Analytics ID into the general settings. Other settings (e.g. AnonymizeIP) are preconfigured accordingly and need to be changed only when needed or when extensions are desired.

For a privacy-compliant integration, it is necessary that you clarify the use of Google Analytics in your privacy policy. Additionally, a possibility for an opt-out of Google Analytics must be created. For the opt-out you can use the shortcode described in the tab general, point 3.

In the advanced settings features of Google Analytics can be activated. Corresponding information can be found in the settings.
